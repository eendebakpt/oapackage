	(FF) designs with 2-levels and large run sizes N=128 (m=8–64 factors),
	N=256 (m=9–28, 109–119), N=512 (m=10–25, 238–246), N=1024 (m=11–24,
	488–501), N=2048 (m=12–23), and N=4096 (m=13–24). Such an extensive
	catalog was produced because of an improved algorithm. We extend
	the catalog by 36 MA, 2-level regular FF designs: N=256 (m=29–36,
	100–108), N=512 (m=26–29), N=1024 (m=25–28), N=2048 (m=24–32), and
	N=4096 (m=25–26). Although such enumeration problems are notoriously
	difficult with increased N and/or m, we brought the newly solved
	problems within computational reach by changing the vital isomorphism
	check component of Xu’s algorithm. Here we present a new, compact
	graph for solving regular design isomorphism problems and use the
	nauty program to solve the corresponding graph isomorphism problems.
	Supplemental appendices are available online. },

	criteria are defined using a set of J values, called J&hyphen;characteristics.
	In this paper, we show that a factorial design is uniquely determined
	by its J&hyphen;characteristics just as a regular factorial design
	is uniquely determined by its defining relation. The theorem is given
	through an explicit formula that relates the set of design points
	to that of J&hyphen;characteristics. Through this formula, projection
