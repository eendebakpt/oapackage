# Summary

Orthogonal arrays, optimal designs and conference designs are important tools for the design of
experiments [@Elster1995], [@hedayat2012orthogonal], [@Wu2009]. The OApackage (Orthogonal Array package) contains functionality 
to generate and analyse these types of designs. More specifically, the OApackage allows 
the user to:

* Efficiently generate orthogonal arrays, optimal designs and conference designs
* Reduce the designs to their normal form and perform isomorphism testing 
* Calculate a wide variety of statistical properties of the designs

The data analysis of the experiments conducted using the generated designs is left to 
existing statistical software such as R [@Rpackage] and JMP [@wiki:JMP].

To generate orthogonal arrays and conference designs, the OApackage uses an exhaustive 
generation procedure with isomorphism pruning [@Eendebak2009], [@Schoen2018dsd]. To generate 
optimal designs, the package uses a flexible optimality criterion and a coordinate-exchange 
optimization algorithm [@Eendebak2015].

The reduction of the designs to their normal form is done by either reduction to a minimal form 
(such as lexicographically minimal in columns or delete-one-factor projection normal form [@EendebakDOF])
or reduction using graph algorithms. For designs with a specified isomorphism group,
the OApackage provides a generic interface to the graph reduction algorithms that effectively perform isomorphism 
testing and reduction to normal form.

The OApackage evaluates the orthogonal arrays, optimal designs and conference designs using well-known statistical criteria. For instance,
the package can calculate the generalized wordlength pattern and confounding frequency vector [@Tang1999], which are based
on the J-characteristics [@Deng1999],
and the number of degrees of freedom available for estimating selected factors' effects.
The package can also calculate the $F_4$ vector of
conference designs [@Schoen2018dsd] and the D-efficiency of optimal designs [@Goos2011]. 

The OApackage consists of a C++ library with a Python interface generated
by SWIG. The source code is available at https://github.com/eendebakpt/oapackage. Examples for both 
generation and analysis of designs are available in the OApackage documentation [@OAdocumentation].
The Orthogonal Array package website [@EendebakOAwebsite] contains a large collection of orthogonal arrays, 
optimal designs and conference designs. An alternative collection of orthogonal arrays is available from
the website of Neil Sloane [@SloaneOAwebsite].
