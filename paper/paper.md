# Summary

Orthogonal arrays, optimal designs and conference designs are important tools in the design of
experiments [@Hedayat1999]. The Orthogonal Array
package contains functionality to generate and analyse these various designs.

The main functionality of the package consists of:

* Generation of orthogonal arrays, optimal designs and conference designs
* Reduction to normal form and isomophism testing of designs 
* Calculation of statistical properties of designs

The application of generated designs to analyse experiments is left to exising packages such as
R [@Rpackage] and JMP [@wiki:JMP].

For generation of orthogonal arrays and conference designs we use an exhaustive generation of designs with ismorphism pruning
[@Eendebak2009], [@IsomorphismPaper]. The optimal designs are generated using a flexible optimality criterium and
a coordinate-exchange optimization algorithm [@Eendebak2015].
A large collection of designs generated with the package can be found on the Orthogonal Array
packagewebsite [@EendebakOA]. Another large collection of designs is the website of Neil
Sloane [@Sloanewebsite]. 

The reduction to normal form is done by either reduction to a minimal form (such as lexicographic minimal in columns or
delete-of-factor projection normal form [@EendebakDOF]) or reduction using graph algorithms.
A generic interface to the graph reduction algorithms if Nauty [@nauty] is provided to perform ismophism testing and reduction to normal form fo
r designs with a specified isomorphism group.


Once design have been generated, various statistical properties of the designs can be calculated. These include
generalized wordlength patterns, J-characteristics and the ranks of various matrices.

The package consists of a C++ library with an easy Python interface generated by SWIG.
The source code is available at https://github.com/eendebakpt/oapackage.
Examples for both generation and analysis of designs are available in 
the OApackage documentation [@OAdocumentation].
